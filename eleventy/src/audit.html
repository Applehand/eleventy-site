                <h3>1.2 Summary of Main Findings</h3>
                
                    <p>Search crawlers are struggling to understand the site and which pages are important for the
                        index.
                    </p>
                    <hr />
                    <p>The following items are most telling:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Poor crawl budget utilization</li>
                        <li>Poor Management of URLs regarding readability, query parameters, and canonicals.</li>
                        <li>Site Speed: ~70% of URLs are slow or medium speed</li>
                        <li>Duplicate Meta Descriptions, H1s, &amp; Titles (content likely as well)</li>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Crawlability & Indexability</h2>
            <p>The site is large and lacks enough contextual signals for crawlers to process effectively.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>3.7 million total unique URLs. 2.3 million have been crawled.</p>
            <p>908k URLs are indexable, but only 198k URLs are actually indexed.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>2.1. Robots.txt &amp; Meta Robots Tags</h3>
                <p>1.4k indexed URLs are being blocked by robots.txt. Why?</p>
                <p>Around 1 million pages, including many with potential value, are blocked from indexing by a noindex
                    tag.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>2.2. XML Sitemaps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>614k total URLs in sitemap, only 75k indexed. 215k URLs in sitemap not crawled. 23k
                        non-indexable
                        pages in sitemap.</li>
                    <li>122k URLs are indexed and not in the sitemap.</li>
                    <li>373 non-200 status URLs in the sitemap.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Reorganize sitemap categories within the sitemap index.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>2.3. Crawl Budget</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total URLs: 3.7M unique pages</li>
                    <li>Average Crawl Depth: 6.5</li>
                    <li>2.3 million crawled URLs, only ~200k are indexed</li>

                <h3>2.4. Canonical Tags &amp; Duplicate Content</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>337k pages have no canonical tag</li>
                    <li>1.9 million pages have "same" canonical</li>
                    <li>3k pages have "other" canonical</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Pages with the "same" canonical type might need to point to a master version to avoid duplicate
                    content issues</p>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Site Speed &amp; Core Web Vitals</h2>
            
                <p>~70% of the site is slow or medium speed. Key areas to monitor include:</p>
                <hr />
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Page Load Performance:</strong> Measure metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and
                        Time
                        to First Byte (TTFB).</li>
                    <li><strong>Render-Blocking Resources:</strong> Identify and optimize unoptimized CSS/JavaScript
                        that
                        delay rendering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Image &amp; Media Optimization:</strong> Ensure images are compressed, responsive, and
                        lazy-loaded.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Consider setting up a CDN.</p>
            
        </section>


        <!-- 4. Mobile-Friendliness & User Experience -->
        <section>
            <h2>4. Mobile-Friendliness &amp; User Experience</h2>
            
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Responsive Design Issues:</strong> Address layout shifts. There are 869k URLs that lack
                        image height/width
                        attributes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile Page Speed:</strong> Assess if mobile performance lags behind desktop and
                        identify
                        improvement areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Evaluate mobile navigation, touch target sizes, and overall
                        usability for a smoother experience.</li>
                </ul>

        <!-- 5. Structured Data & Rich Snippets -->
        <section>
            <h2>5. Structured Data &amp; Rich Snippets</h2>
            
                <p>No structured data is currently implemented.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Opportunity:</strong> Implement JSON-LD schema for key page types to enhance search
                        visibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Rich snippets can improve click-through rates and provide clear
                        context
                        to search engines.</li>
                </ul>

        <!-- 6. Internal Linking & Site Architecture -->
        <section>
            <h2>6. Internal Linking &amp; Site Architecture</h2>
            <p>A site of this size needs a strong internal linking strategy to signal to crawlers which pages are
                important, and to improve overall crawlability.</p>
            <p>1.4 million URLs have 0 internal inbound links, 64k of which are indexed without having been crawled.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
            <section>
                <h3>6.1. Navigation Depth &amp; Link Equity</h3>
                <p>
                    Key pages require over 3 clicks to access; the average crawl depth is 6.42.
                    Optimizing internal links can distribute link equity better and improve page discoverability.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>6.2. Anchor Text Optimization</h3>
                <p>
                    Ensure internal links use descriptive, keyword-rich anchor text to boost relevancy signals.
                    Audit current links to identify opportunities for improvement.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>6.3. Broken Links &amp; Redirect Issues</h3>
                <p>
                    There are 4,799 URLs returning 404 errors, many with numerous internal links.
                    Streamlining these issues can help preserve link equity and enhance user navigation.

        </section>
        <section>
            <section>
                <h3>7.1. URL Readability</h3>
                <p>
                    URLs are currently not short, descriptive, or keyword-friendly. Improving URL readability can
                    enhance user experience and signal relevance to search engines.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>7.2. Canonicalization of URLs</h3>
                <p>
                    While www vs. non-www and HTTP vs. HTTPS are mostly consistent, canonical tag implementation likely
                    needs
                    refinement. Many pages use self-referencing canonicals when consolidation to a master version would
                    be more effective, potentially causing duplicate content issues.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>7.3. Query String Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Query string parameters may be creating duplicate content issues. Consider moving these parameters
                    to HTTP headers or POST requests to streamline URLs and improve indexation.
