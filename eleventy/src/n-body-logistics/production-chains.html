<h1>Resources, Buildings, and Production Chains</h1><p>Initial Content Design: Resources & Production
    The goal is to create a flexible system that allows for specialization. We'll start with a basic foundation and build up to more complex, planet-specific resources.</p><ol>
    <li>Foundational Resources (Initial Planet - 'Gaia' Biome)</li>
    </ol><p>Let's imagine the starting planet, "Terra Nova," has a familiar, Earth-like "Gaia" biome. These resources are the bedrock of your early operations. They are abundant and relatively easy to extract.</p><ul>
    <li>1.1. Tier 1: Raw Materials
    <ul>
    <li>Ore: Basic metallic ore, used in a wide range of components.</li>
    <li>Silicates: Sand-like material, essential for glass and electronics.</li>
    <li>Water Ice: Solid water, a crucial resource for life support, coolant, and chemical reactions.</li>
    <li>Crude Oil: Organic liquid, a primary energy source and precursor for polymers.</li>
    <li>Biomass: Organic matter from flora, used for basic fuel and nutrient paste.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>1.2. Tier 2: Refined Materials (Simple Processing)

    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul><ol>
    <li>Specialized Resources (Planet Biomes)</li>
    </ol><p>To encourage interplanetary expansion and specialization, each new planet will have unique, high-value resources. This is where players can find niches.</p><ul>

    </li>
    </ul><ol>
    <li>Basic Production Chain Flow & Buildings</li>
    </ol><p>Here is a simplified, sci-fi production chain, starting from raw extraction and moving up to complex products.
    Tier 1: Extraction & Refinement</p><ul>
    <li>Extraction Buildings (Mines & Drills):
    <ul>
    <li>Ore Mine: Extracts Ore from deposits.</li>
    <li>Silicate Quarry: Extracts Silicates from sand deposits.</li>
    <li>Water Ice Extractor: Gathers Water Ice.</li>
    <li>Oil Derrick: Drills for Crude Oil.</li>
    <li>Biomass Harvester: Gathers Biomass.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Refinement Buildings (Processors):
    <ul>
    <li>Basic Smelter: Ore &rarr; Metal Ingots.</li>
    <li>Glass Kiln: Silicates &rarr; Glass.</li>
    <li>Water Purifier: Water Ice &rarr; Refined Water.</li>
    <li>Refinery: Crude Oil &rarr; Polymers, Fuel.</li>
    <li>Nutrient Processor: Biomass &rarr; Nutrient Paste.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul><p>Tier 2: Component Manufacturing</p><ul>
    <li>Component Assembly Buildings:
    <ul>
    <li>Component Fabricator: Metal Ingots + Glass &rarr; Basic Components (e.g., gears, frames).</li>
    <li>Electronics Assembler: Metal Ingots + Polymers + Basic Components &rarr; Circuit Boards.</li>
    <li>Chemical Plant: Refined Water + Polymers &rarr; Coolant.</li>
    <li>Life Support Packager: Nutrient Paste + Refined Water &rarr; Life Support Rations.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul><p>Tier 3: Product Manufacturing & Specialization
    This is where the player's choices matter. You can focus on a few key product lines.</p><ul>
    <li>Robotics/Automation Line:
    <ul>
    <li>Drone Assembly Plant: Basic Components + Circuit Boards &rarr; Logistics Drones (for transport)</li>
    <li>Robotics Factory: Metal Ingots + Circuit Boards + Rare Earth Minerals &rarr; Automated Mining Bots (for advanced extraction)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Shipbuilding/Aerospace Line:
    <ul>
    <li>Shipyard: Metal Ingots + Polymers + Coolant + Basic Components &rarr; Ship Hull</li>
    <li>Propulsion System Plant: Metal Ingots + Sulfur + Fuel &rarr; Thrusters</li>
    <li>Navigation Module Workshop: Circuit Boards + Exotic Crystals &rarr; Navigation Modules</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Consumer Goods / Life Support Line:
    <ul>
    <li>Habitation Unit Factory: Metal Ingots + Glass + Life Support Rations &rarr; Prefab Habitation Units</li>
    <li>Medical Supply Lab: Polymers + Refined Water + Biomass &rarr; Medical Kits</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul><p>Tier 4: Advanced Products (Late Game)
    These require high-tier resources from specialized biomes.</p><ul>
    <li>Fusion Reactor: Heavy Water + Exotic Crystals + Rare Earth Minerals &rarr; Fusion Reactor Core</li>
    <li>Quantum Supercomputer: Quantum Crystals + Circuit Boards + Cryogenic Gases &rarr; Quantum Computer</li>
    </ul><ol>
    <li>Specialization & Business Models</li>
    </ol><p>This production chain naturally allows for different business models:</p><ul>
    <li>The Extractor: Focus on raw resource extraction. Your profit comes from selling raw Ore, Silicates, and Crude Oil to other companies (or the open market). You'd invest heavily in mining and drilling technology.</li>
    <li>The Manufacturer: Focus on refining and component manufacturing. You buy raw resources, turn them into high-value components (e.g., Circuit Boards, Coolant), and sell those. Your reputation is built on product quality.</li>
    <li>The Logistics Provider: Focus on building and managing a fleet of logistics drones and cargo ships. You offer transportation services to other companies, moving resources and products between planets for a fee.</li>
    <li>The Integrated Conglomerate: You manage the entire chain from extraction to final product. This requires a huge investment but offers the highest profit margins and resilience to market fluctuations.</li>
    <li>The Tech Innovator: You specialize in researching and producing the most advanced, high-tier components (e.g., Quantum Computers, Fusion Cores) and sell them at a premium.</li>
    </ul><p>This setup gives you a clear path for resource progression and allows the player to choose their business strategy from the beginning. You can start as a simple extractor and then expand into manufacturing or logistics as you grow.</p>
