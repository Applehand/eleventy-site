<h1>Business and Economics</h1><ol>
    <li>Game Systems for Corporate Management</li>
    </ol><p>The player's role is to manage divisions, not micromanage individual buildings. This means the systems should reflect this macro-level control.
    A. Corporate Structure & Divisional Management</p><ul>
    <li>Divisional Hierarchy: The company is broken down into divisions, each with a CEO or Director that reports to the player (as Chief Corporate Officer).
    <ul>
    <li>Extraction Division: Manages all mining, drilling, and harvesting operations across the solar system.</li>
    <li>Manufacturing Division: Oversees all factories, production lines, and component assembly.</li>
    <li>Logistics Division: Controls the fleet of ships and drones, managing trade routes and resource distribution.</li>
    <li>Security Division: Handles pirate threats, corporate espionage, and asset protection.</li>
    <li>Research & Development (R&D) Division: Manages the research of new technologies and equipment.</li>
    <li>Human Resources (HR) Division: Handles employee hiring, training, and promotions.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Divisional Budgets & Allocations: Instead of a single company bank account, the player allocates a budget to each division at the start of a quarter.
    <ul>
    <li>The player sets a budget for Extraction for new mining bots, for Logistics for new ships, etc.</li>
    <li>Each division's CEO has a "spending efficiency" and "effectiveness" stat that determines how well they use the budget. A good CEO can do more with less.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Performance Metrics & Reporting: The game presents the player with reports from each division, using charts and graphs.
    <ul>
    <li>Extraction: "Planetary Output," "Resource Reserves," "Extraction Efficiency."</li>
    <li>Manufacturing: "Production Rate," "Product Quality," "Waste Rate."</li>
    <li>Logistics: "Delivery Success Rate," "Fuel Consumption," "Route Efficiency."</li>
    <li>Security: "Asset Loss Rate," "Pirate Encounters," "Intelligence Gathered."</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul><p>B. Stockholder & Public Relations System</p><ul>
    <li>Stock Price: The company's stock price is a key indicator of success. It fluctuates based on performance metrics, profits, major events, and market trends.</li>
    <li>Reputation Score: A global score that affects loan interest rates, government contracts, and public perception. It can be influenced by environmental disasters, employee satisfaction, and contract fulfillment.</li>
    <li>Shareholder Factions: Your shareholders are not a monolith. They can be divided into factions with competing interests:
    <ul>
    <li>Venture Capitalists: Care only about short-term profits and aggressive expansion. They demand high quarterly returns.</li>
    <li>Legacy Investors: A family of old-money investors who care about long-term stability and reputation. They are wary of risky ventures.</li>
    <li>Government Representatives: Appointed by governments you have contracts with. They care about meeting quotas and operational security.</li>
    <li>The Workforce Union: Represents the employees. Cares about worker safety, wages, and promotions.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Corporate Politics: The player must navigate these factions. Fulfilling one faction's demands might alienate another. For example, cutting safety measures to please VCs could anger the Workforce Union and lead to a strike.</li>
    </ul><p>C. Market & Economic Model</p><ul>
    <li>Dynamic Supply & Demand: Each resource has a supply and demand value for the entire solar system.
    <ul>
    <li>Supply: Player production + NPC faction production.</li>
    <li>Demand: Player consumption + NPC faction consumption + galactic market demand.</li>
    <li>Prices fluctuate based on this dynamic. If you flood the market with Metal Ingots, the price drops.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Contracts & Market Tenders: The player can accept contracts from governments or other corporations.
    <ul>
    <li>Delivery Contracts: "Deliver 500 Life Support Rations to the Mars colony."</li>
    <li>Construction Contracts: "Build a Water Purifier on Titan."</li>
    <li>Security Contracts: "Destroy pirate fleets in the asteroid belt."</li>
    <li>These contracts have deadlines and affect reputation and cash flow.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>NPC Factions: The economy isn't just you. There are other corporations and governmental factions that extract, manufacture, and trade.
    <ul>
    <li>Sol-Corp Mining: Your main competitor in resource extraction.</li>
    <li>Ares Manufacturing: Specializes in advanced military components.</li>
    <li>Galactic Trade Federation: A neutral market hub where you can buy and sell resources.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul><ol>
    <li>Quarterly and Yearly Events</li>
    </ol><p>These events provide structure to the game's timeline and a sense of progression beyond just building.
    Quarterly (Every 1-3 Hours of Gameplay)</p><ul>
    <li>Quarterly Report: The game pauses, and you receive a detailed financial report.
    <ul>
    <li>Income Statement: Revenue from sales/contracts, expenses (salaries, maintenance, fuel), and net profit/loss.</li>
    <li>Balance Sheet: Assets (ships, buildings, cash) vs. Liabilities (loans, debt).</li>
    <li>Performance Review: Reports from each divisional CEO on their progress and challenges.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Budget Allocation Meeting: Based on the report, you decide how to allocate the next quarter's budget to each division.</li>
    <li>Mini-Events:
    <ul>
    <li>"Supply Chain Disruption": A meteor shower damages a logistics route, requiring a reroute or repairs.</li>
    <li>"Employee of the Quarter": A popup highlights a character's success, giving a small bonus and a reputation boost.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul><p>Yearly (Every 4 Quarters)</p><ul>
    <li>Annual Shareholder Meeting: This is a major event.
    <ul>
    <li>Presentation: You present your company's performance for the year. The game will display key metrics on a projected screen.</li>
    <li>Q&A Session: Shareholder factions ask you questions based on their interests.
    <ul>
    <li>VC: "Why was our quarterly profit growth only 5%? What's the plan for Q1 next year?"</li>
    <li>Union: "There have been several safety incidents in the mines. What are you doing to protect our workforce?"</li>
    <li>Government: "The delivery quota for Propulsion Systems was not met. Is the company failing its contract?"</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Resolutions: You might need to vote on resolutions proposed by shareholders, such as "Increase R&D budget by 20%" or "Invest in automated security drones." Your reputation and the stock price are on the line.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Yearly Corporate Awards:
    <ul>
    <li>"Division of the Year" (e.g., Logistics wins for efficiency).</li>
    <li>"CEO of the Year" (the CEO with the highest spending effectiveness).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Corporate Lore Update: The CorporateLore singleton is updated with highlights from the year, like major contracts, disasters, or character promotions.</li>
    </ul><p>Long-Term (10, 50, 100+ Years)</p><ul>
    <li>Company Anniversaries: Milestone events with special contracts, large reputation bonuses, and historical lore popups.</li>
    <li>High-Profile Retirements: A long-serving employee retires, a character you promoted from a line worker to a CEO. This adds to the legacy and can trigger a bonus event or a lore entry.</li>
    <li>Disaster Memorials: If a major disaster occurred (e.g., a catastrophic factory meltdown), an anniversary popup can remind the player of the event, affecting reputation and employee morale.</li>
    <li>Company Strikes: If the Workforce Union faction is ignored for too long, they may organize a strike, shutting down a division until you meet their demands.</li>
    <li>Legacies: The most successful campaigns become "corporate lore," adding new employee names and background stories to the pool for future campaigns.</li>
    </ul><ol>
    <li>Approaching the Economics & What to Study</li>
    </ol><p>You don't need a PhD in economics, but understanding a few key concepts will be invaluable.</p><ul>
    <li>
    <ol>
    <li>Microeconomics 101:</li>
    </ol>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Supply & Demand: The fundamental force that drives prices. If supply is low and demand is high, the price goes up.</li>
    <li>Marginal Utility: The value of an extra unit of something. The first 10 Metal Ingots are super valuable, but the 10,000th are less so. This can inform diminishing returns for large-scale production.</li>
    <li>Production Costs: Fixed costs (buildings, salaries) vs. variable costs (fuel, raw materials).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <ol>
    <li>Corporate Finance Basics:</li>
    </ol>
    
    <ul>
    <li>The Three Financial Statements: The Income Statement (profit/loss over time), the Balance Sheet (assets/liabilities at a moment in time), and the Cash Flow Statement (how cash moves in and out). You can simplify these into a player-facing report.</li>
    <li>Capital Allocation: How a company decides where to invest its money (e.g., R&D, new ships, dividends to shareholders). This is your core gameplay loop.</li>
    <li>Return on Investment (ROI): How much profit you get back from an investment. This is the key metric for the player's decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <ol>
    <li>Game Economy Design:</li>
    </ol>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Taps and Sinks: A game design concept. "Taps" are sources of resources (extraction, contracts), and "Sinks" are places where they are used or removed (building costs, maintenance). A balanced economy needs effective sinks to prevent resource hoarding and inflation.</li>
    <li>Player-Driven vs. Designer-Driven Economy: Will you set the prices, or will they be determined by player/NPC supply and demand? A dynamic, player-driven economy is more complex but more engaging.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <ol>
    <li>Scifi/Real-World Logistics & Space Economics:</li>
    </ol>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Kerbal Space Program and Factorio are great for practical inspiration on logistics and production chains.</li>
    <li>Read about space economics and the challenges of interplanetary trade: high transportation costs, travel time, and unique resource distribution. This is a great source of "frictional" gameplay. For example, a cargo ship from Mars to Jupiter's moons might take a year, making a trade route valuable but slow. This can create opportunities for transportation-focused players.</li>
    </ul>
