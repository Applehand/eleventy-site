  <h3>Jake who?</h3>
  <p>I'm a full-stack web developer and SEO analyst with a diverse technical skillset. I am driven
    by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning, and I seek to create impactful solutions that blend
    technical precision with actionable insights.</p>
  <p>
    Drawing from my foundation in language composition, I turn complexity into clarity by creating systems that are not
    only logical but also user-friendly and effective. Whether I'm developing a custom app, writing a technical guide,
    or analyzing search metrics, my goal is to create tools and discover insights that make a difference.
