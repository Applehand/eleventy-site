    <h1>Title I: Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry</h1>
    <p>This title of H.R. 1 makes significant changes to programs related to agriculture, nutrition, and forestry. The changes are far-reaching, affecting everything from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to crop insurance and conservation programs. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key provisions in this title.</p>

    <h2>Subtitle A: Nutrition</h2>
    <p>This subtitle focuses on changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the food stamp program.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="../pdf/BILLS-119hr1eas.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Re-evaluation of Thrifty Food Plan:</a></strong> The bill requires a re-evaluation of the Thrifty Food Plan, which is the basis for determining SNAP benefit amounts. This could result in a significant change in the amount of food assistance that low-income families receive. The bill states that the re-evaluation will be based on "current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance."
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="../pdf/BILLS-119hr1eas.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Modifications to SNAP Work Requirements:</a></strong> The bill tightens work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents. It also expands the definition of who is considered an able-bodied adult.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="../pdf/BILLS-119hr1eas.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">Restrictions on Internet Expenses:</a></strong> The bill prohibits the use of SNAP benefits to pay for internet service. This could make it more difficult for low-income families to access online resources for job searching, education, and other essential services.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subtitle B: Forestry</h2>
    <p>This subtitle rescinds funding for a number of forestry programs, which could have a significant impact on the management of national forests and the prevention of wildfires.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="../pdf/BILLS-119hr1eas.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Rescission of Amounts for Forestry:</a></strong> The bill rescinds unobligated funds for a number of forestry programs, including those related to hazardous fuels reduction, forest restoration, and wildfire prevention.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subtitle C: Commodities</h2>
    <p>This subtitle makes a number of changes to agricultural commodity programs, including those that provide price supports and risk management tools for farmers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="../pdf/BILLS-119hr1eas.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Effective Reference Price:</a></strong> The bill increases the effective reference price for a number of commodities, which could result in higher subsidy payments to farmers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="../pdf/BILLS-119hr1eas.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Base Acres:</a></strong> The bill makes changes to the way that base acres are calculated, which could affect the amount of subsidies that farmers receive.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subtitle D: Disaster Assistance Programs</h2>
    <p>This subtitle makes changes to a number of disaster assistance programs for farmers and ranchers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="../pdf/BILLS-119hr1eas.pdf#page=69" target="_blank">Supplemental Agricultural Disaster Assistance:</a></strong> The bill makes changes to the Supplemental Agricultural Disaster Assistance program, which provides assistance to farmers and ranchers who have been affected by natural disasters.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subtitle E: Crop Insurance</h2>
    <p>This subtitle makes a number of changes to the federal crop insurance program, which is a key risk management tool for farmers.</p>
